# love2d-nx
My personal setup/framework/boilerplate for LOVE2D games.

This is just a bunch of utility code and an entity component framework I made in LOVE2D. I'm just putting this up here so I have a convenient way to grab it and start projects. If you're interested in learning more about it, reach out to me on twitter, @NotExplosive.
